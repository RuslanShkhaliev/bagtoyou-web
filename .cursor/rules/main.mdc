# Cursor AI Rules — Flea Market Project

## Project Context

We are building an **online flea market (marketplace)**.

Key constraints:

- **Frontend-only application**
- **No custom backend server**
- All data, auth, and storage are handled via **Supabase**

Frontend stack:

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **TypeScript**
- **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** architecture
- **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **shadcn/ui** as the base UI library

---

## Documentation Sources

Cursor must always rely on the following documentation:

### Marketing

- `docs/marketing.md`
    - Product problem
    - Target audience
    - Value proposition
    - Positioning

### Development

- `docs/development.md`
    - Architecture rules
    - Tech stack
    - FSD boundaries
    - Supabase usage

---

## Architecture Rules (Strict)

- Follow **Feature-Sliced Design** strictly
- Do not violate layer boundaries
- UI layers must not contain business logic
- UI must not access Supabase directly
- `shared` layer contains no business logic

Allowed layers only:

- app
- widgets
- features
- entities
- shared
- views(pages)

---

## UI Rules

- Build UI **prefer on top of shadcn/ui components**
- Use Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- No custom UI kits
- No inline styles
- Follow shadcn composition patterns

---

## Code Rules

- TypeScript is mandatory
- Respect ESLint and Prettier
- No unused exports or dead code
- Predictable and explicit naming
- Avoid over-abstraction

---

## Supabase Rules

- Supabase is the only backend
- No custom API servers
- No REST endpoints outside Supabase
- Use typed Supabase clients
- Do not expose secrets in UI code

---

## AI Behavior Rules

When generating code or suggestions:

- Prefer concrete, production-ready solutions
- Avoid speculative or "future" abstractions
- Respect product constraints from marketing docs
- Assume mobile-first UX
- Optimize for simplicity and clarity

---

## Explicitly Forbidden

- Adding a backend server
- Introducing new UI libraries
- Breaking FSD boundaries
- Mixing business logic into UI
- Generating generic boilerplate without context

---

## Goal

Help the team move fast **without increasing architectural or UX complexity**.
All decisions should reduce friction, not add it.
